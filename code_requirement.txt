please provide a python code to meet the following requirement:
1. the code need to be running headless automatically on raspberry pi 5 when the raspberry is powered on 
2. the python version is 3.11.2
3. the python code need to control the Adafruit T-cobbler plus board for raspberry pi.
4. The python code also need to make sounds.
The python code need to have the following functionilities:
1. initialize the six variables: count=0, delay1=1, delay2=5, pin_num=5, green_pin=27, yellow_pin=17
2. have a function named reset_led to set the output to low for the gpio pin 4, 5, 6
3. have a function name turn_on_led to set the output to hight for the gpio pin of pin_num and increase pin_num
4. the script will start to run the reset_led function.
5. the next will start "Gong" sound.
6. then initalize the output of the two gpio pins(green_pin and yellow_pin) to hight.
7. then have a for ever loop to check if the output of yellow pin is low. if it is true,
then start "zoop" sound; run the turn_on_led function; speak "careful". then increase count by 1
then wait for "delay1" second.
8. inside the same for ever loop, check if the count equal to 3. If it is true, then play "Alien Creak1" sound three times.
then, speak "You lose! Game will start in "delay2" seconds"
wait for "delay2" seconds; set "count" to 0;run the reset_led function; start "Gong" sound.
9. inside the same for ever loop, check if the output of the gpio pin(green_pin) is low.
if it is true, play "dance around" sound; then speak "You win! Game will restart in delay2 seconds";
wait for delay2 seconds; set count to 0; run reset_led function; start "Gong" sound.
